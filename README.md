As a student at the University of Maryland I coauthored and published several papers in supersymmetry under the supervision of Dr. Jim Gates. Now Dr. Gates is at Brown University and I'm taking time to work in industry as a software engineer and data scientist and filling out my proper background in mathematical and theoretical physics on the side. Until I have a chance to make a pretty website, this is where I plan to keep my notes.

These notes are mostly sourced from the QFT books by Peskin and Schroeder, Weinberg, Carroll's GR book, and various materials by Gregory Naber. All errors are probably my own. Most material is unoriginal, although some exposition is my own.
